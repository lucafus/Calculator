# Calculator

Pseudocode

I have to create a function that will calculate the numbers I generate in the display


Once the numbers are displayed I will add the operands directly to the screen 


A calculation function will be created and located here, it will get the number and operands and do the calculation


I need to found a way to get the results of the number inputs and use it alongside with the operands 


Once this is complete I need the = operand to fire the calculate function and showcase the result on the display


The clear button is already created and will erase the operation once its finished
